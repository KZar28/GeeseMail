Purpose:
  New groupchat app because I refuse to use Groupme, WhatsApp (basically Facebook), Facebook Messenger (Literally Facebook)

  And most importantly to prove Espejo and Jerry wrong.

TODO:
  - Display Users
    - Displays onJoin, onLeave, and onMembers but needs some bug fixes
    - Bugs:
        - Disable the editable text
        - Fix the member counter

  - Major Bug -> Activity not quitting if back from chat screen to home screen
    - creates duplicate users, not sure how?!

  - Third Activity currently does nothing
    - customizable welcome / join message?

  - Store Messages?
    - Message history should be built into API, but haven't gotten it to work yet
