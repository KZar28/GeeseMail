Purpose:
  New groupchat app because fuck Groupme, WhatsApp (Facebook), and most importantly to prove Espejo and Jerry wrong.

TODO:
  - Home Screen
    - Select Channel rather than hardcode directly into BoolChat channelID
    - Mostly for commercial purposes, if just for the groupchat then screw it

  - Display Users
    - On Leave, On Join, and display active users at the top?

  - Store Messages
